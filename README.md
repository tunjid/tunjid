# Hi there üëãüèø

I love to build things, like bad puns, and enjoy football. 

I'm also on the Media Foundations Team at Airbnb, and prior to that, the developer relations team at Google.

I'm a co-author of the [official Android Architecture guide](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture), and identify as a functional reactive programming zealot.

Pinned are a few of my favorite things.
